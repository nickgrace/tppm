<p>FYSB’s Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program administers 172 grants throughout the nation and several U.S. territories. These programs target vulnerable populations by providing culturally relevant and age-appropriate comprehensive and abstinence-only sex education.  To reduce factors that put youth at risk and boost factors that protect them, grantees enhance the youth experience by providing mentoring, counseling, adult supervision and/or programming on adulthood preparation subjects.</p>
